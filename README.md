# IMDB Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing various datasets from IMDB (Internet Movie Database) to gain insights into movie budgets, gross earnings, and other related information. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Main/IMDB Case Study.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main data analysis code.
- `Main/bom.movie_gross.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie gross earnings.
- `Main/name.basics.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie personnel.
- `Main/rt.movie_info.tsv`: Dataset containing information about movie details.
- `Main/rt.reviews.tsv`: Dataset containing information about movie reviews.
- `Main/title.akas.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie titles.
- `Main/title.basics.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie titles and genres.
- `Main/title.crew.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie personnel.
- `Main/title.principals.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie personnel and their roles.
- `Main/title.ratings.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie ratings.
- `Main/tmdb.movies.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie details.
- `Main/tn.movie_budget.csv`: Dataset containing information about movie budgets.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Explore the datasets:** Understand the structure and contents of the provided datasets.
2. **Clean the data:** Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, data type conversions, and data normalization.
3. **Analyze movie budgets and earnings:** Investigate the relationship between movie budgets, domestic gross earnings, and worldwide gross earnings.
4. **Visualize the data:** Create meaningful visualizations using various types of plots and charts to aid in data exploration and communication of insights.
5. **Formulate hypotheses:** Generate hypotheses based on the data analysis and propose potential relationships or patterns in the movie industry.

## Getting Started

To run the data analysis code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.x).

3. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

4. Open the `IMDB Case Study.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and generate the visualizations.

## Results and Interpretation

The analysis provides insights into the relationship between movie budgets and earnings. It examines factors such as production budget, domestic gross, and worldwide gross to identify trends and patterns. The visualizations created help visualize these relationships and facilitate interpretation of the findings.

The results of the analysis can be used to gain a better understanding of the movie industry, make informed decisions related to movie production and budgeting, and explore potential factors influencing movie success.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential future enhancements for the project:

1. Expand the analysis to include more datasets or additional variables for deeper insights.
2. Incorporate advanced statistical techniques to validate hypotheses and make more accurate predictions.
3. Develop interactive visualizations or a web-based dashboard for easier exploration of the data.
4. Conduct sentiment analysis on movie reviews to analyze the impact of critical reception on movie success.
